# Enable Google Ads API

Your Google Cloud project needs to have the Google Ads API enabled.

## Quick Fix

1. **Open this link** (it will take you directly to the API page):
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/googleads.googleapis.com/overview?project=978403786956

2. **Click the "Enable" button** on the page

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the API to activate

4. **Try running the app again**

## Alternative Method

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (project ID: 978403786956)
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**
4. Search for "Google Ads API"
5. Click on it and press **Enable**
6. Wait a few minutes, then retry

## After Enabling

Once enabled, the geo target resolution will work and you'll be able to generate keyword ideas.

The first run may take longer as it resolves all country geo targets, but subsequent runs will be faster thanks to caching.
